To install an SSL certificate chain:

1. At the time the cert is generated, you will be prompted to download
   the private key.  DOWNLOAD THE KEY.  You may have to reissue the cert
   if you don't do this.
2. Download the SSL certificate and intermediate certificate.
3. Log into the server and stop nginx and ballotmatic services.
4. Copy the certificates to the server at /apps/cert.
5. Concatenate the SLL certificate and intermediate certificate:
   cat ballotomatic.com_ssl_certificate.cer _.ballotomatic.com_ssl_certificate_INTERMEDIATE.cer > ballotomatic-chained.crt
6. Copy the private key file to ballotomatic.key.
7. Restart nginx and ballotomatic services.
8. Verify the services started and log in to ballotomatic.com to verify the connection is encrypted.
